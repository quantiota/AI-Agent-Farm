Currently, the AI Agent Lab  provides a seamless interface for managing and querying data, visualizing results, and coding in real-time while working with GPT-3.5 models. However, it would be highly beneficial to have a set of ready-to-use notebooks that we can use with this plugin, specifically in the field of data science.

Therefore, we propose creating a set of data streams processing notebooks with corresponding machine learning notebooks to be used with the AI Agent Lab. These notebooks will provide users with a variety of data sources to choose from and machine learning templates to work with, making it easier to start experimenting with GPT-3.5 models in the field of data science.

The available data sources could include but are not limited to:

- Public datasets from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Streaming data sources such as Twitter API or stock market data
- Web scraping tools to extract data from websites

The machine learning templates could include but are not limited to:

- Classification and regression algorithms
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis or text classification
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques


With this set of ready-to-use notebooks, users can easily experiment with different data sources and machine learning algorithms without having to start from scratch. It will also serve as a valuable resource for those new to data science and GPT-3.5 models, providing them with a clear starting point for their experimentation.

We welcome contributions from the community to create and maintain this set of notebooks. Let's work together to make the AI Agent Lab a more powerful tool for data scientists!
