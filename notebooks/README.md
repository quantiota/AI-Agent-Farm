Currently, the AI Agent Host  provides a seamless interface for managing and querying data, visualizing results, and coding in real-time. However, it would be highly beneficial to have a set of ready-to-use notebooks that we can use with the AI Agent Host, specifically in the field of data science.

Therefore, we propose creating a set of data streams processing notebooks with corresponding machine learning notebooks to be used with the AI Agent Host. These notebooks will provide users with a variety of data sources to choose from and machine learning templates to work with, making it easier to start experimenting with in the field of data science.

The available data sources could include but are not limited to:

- Public datasets from Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Streaming data sources such as Twitter API or stock market data
- Web scraping tools to extract data from websites

The machine learning templates could include but are not limited to:

- Classification and regression algorithms
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis or text classification
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques


With this set of ready-to-use notebooks, users can easily experiment with different data sources and machine learning algorithms without having to start from scratch. It will also serve as a valuable resource for those new to data science, providing them with a clear starting point for their experimentation.

We welcome contributions from the community to create and maintain this set of notebooks. Let's work together to make the AI Agent Host a more powerful tool for data scientists!
