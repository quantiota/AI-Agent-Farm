## Usage

**Note**: A **fully qualified domain name**  (FQDN) is mandatory for running any notebooks from VSCode over **HTTPS**.


### 1 Generate Certificates with Certbot

We will use the Certbot Docker image to generate certificates. This service will bind on ports 80 and 443, which are the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports, respectively. It will also bind mount some directories for persistent storage of certificates and challenge responses. 

If you want to obtain separate certificates for each subdomain, you will need to run the **certbot certonly** command for each one. You can specify the subdomain for which you want to obtain a certificate with the -d option, like this:

```
docker compose -f init.yaml run certbot certonly -d vscode.yourdomain.tld
```


```
docker compose -f init.yaml run certbot certonly -d questdb.yourdomain.tld
```


```
docker compose -f init.yaml run certbot certonly -d grafana.yourdomain.tld
```

**Important:** Replace **'yourdomain.tld'** with your actual domain in the commands above and in the **'docker-compose.yml'** file.

Please note that the **certonly** command will obtain the certificate but not install it. You will have to configure your Nginx service to use the certificate. Additionally, make sure that your domain points to the server on which you're running this setup, as Let's Encrypt validates domain ownership by making an HTTP request.

Also, remember to periodically renew your certificates, as Let's Encrypt's certificates expire every 90 days. You can automate this task by setting up a cron job or using a similar task scheduling service.


```
# /etc/cron.d/certbot: crontab entries for the certbot package (5 am, every monday)
SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

 0 5 * * 1 docker compose run certbot renew

```

### 2 Setup Environment Variables

Firstly, you will want to create an .env file in the docker folder with the following variables:

```

# VSCode
PASSWORD=yourpassword

# Grafana
GRAFANA_QUESTDB_PASSWORD=quest

# QuestDB
QDB_PG_USER=admin
QDB_PG_PASSWORD=quest

```
and to define your domain name in the docker compose file:

```
    environment:
      - DOMAIN=yourdomain
```

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual domain, passwords, and usernames. 

The environment variables will be replaced directly within the Nginx configuration file when the Docker services are started.


### 3 Generate dhparam.pem file

The **dhparam.pem** file is used for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which is part of establishing a secure TLS connection. You can generate it with OpenSSL. Here's how to generate a 2048-bit key:

```
openssl dhparam -out ./nginx/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
```

Generating a dhparam file can take a long time. For a more secure (but slower) 4096-bit key, simply replace 2048 with 4096 in the above command.

### 4 Generate .htpasswd file for QuestDB 

The user/password are the default one: admin:admin

The **.htpasswd** file is used for basic HTTP authentication. You can change it using the **htpasswd** utility, which is part of the Apache HTTP Server package. Here's how to create an **.htpasswd** file with a user named **yourusername**:
```
htpasswd -c ./nginx/.htpasswd yourusername
```
This command will prompt you for the password for **yourusername**. The **-c** flag tells **htpasswd** to create a new file. **Caution**: Using the **-c** flag will overwrite any existing **.htpasswd** file. 

If **htpasswd** is not installed on your system, you can install it with **apt** on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```


After completing these steps, you can bring up the Docker stack using the following command:

```
docker compose up --build -d
```
This will start all services as defined in your **docker-compose.yaml** file.


## Understanding and Managing Docker Permissions in a Docker Stack

### 1 Docker Volumes Permissions 

The Docker Compose configuration mounts the local directory **../notebooks** to **/home/coder/project** inside the **vscode** service using Docker volumes. This is specified in the **volumes** section of the **vscode** service:

``````
volumes:
  # volume used to access the `notebooks` folder
  - ../notebooks:/home/coder/project
``````

However, this configuration doesn't specify any permission settings for the **../notebooks** directory. Therefore, the permissions inside the container for the mounted directory will be the same as the permissions on the host for **../notebooks.**

In other words, the permissions are determined by the file system of the host machine where the Docker Compose file is run, not by the Docker Compose configuration itself. You can check these permissions using the **ls -l** command in your host system's terminal.

If you want to change the permissions, you would have to do this at the operating system level, outside of Docker. For example, in a Unix-like system, you might use the **chmod** command to change the permissions of the **../notebooks** directory.

Please note that if the **coder** user in your Docker container needs specific permissions (e.g., to write to the **/home/coder/project** directory), you will need to ensure that the host-level permissions for **../notebooks** allow for this. Otherwise, you may run into permission errors.

If you wish to enforce specific permissions within the container regardless of host permissions, you would likely need to handle this in the Dockerfile used to build your image, for example by adding **RUN chmod** commands to change the permissions after the volume is mounted. But keep in mind that it might not always work depending on the volume's nature, and the Dockerfile does not have direct access to the volumes at build time.

Another option would be to use an entrypoint script in your Dockerfile that modifies the permissions of the directory when the container starts, but again, be cautious about potential security implications of changing permissions in this way.


### 2 Setting Default File and Directory Permissions for Git Clone Operations

The permissions for files and directories created by **git clone** are determined by your system's settings, not by Git itself. The most important of these settings is the **umask**, a value that determines the default permissions for newly created files and directories.

When you run **git clone**, Git creates a new directory for the repository, and the permissions for this directory are determined by subtracting the umask from **777** (for directories) or **666** (for files). The resulting permissions apply to the cloned directory and all files within.

If you want to change the default permissions for **git clone**, you can temporarily change the umask before running the command. For example, if you want the cloned directory to have permissions of **755** (rwxr-xr-x), you could set the umask to **022** like so:

```
umask 022
git clone https://github.com/quantiota/AI-Agent-Host.git
```

This will only affect the current shell session. If you want to change the umask permanently, you can add the **umask 022** command to your shell's initialization file (like **~/.bashrc** or **~/.bash_profile** for the Bash shell).

Keep in mind that this will affect all file and directory creation operations in your system, not just **git clone**, so be careful when changing the umask.

Remember that you can always change the permissions of a directory or file after it's created using the **chmod** command. For example:

```
chmod 755 /path/to/directory
```

This command will change the permissions of the specified directory to **755**, regardless of the umask or the directory's initial permissions.
