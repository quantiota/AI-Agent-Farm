# AI Agent Host

The AI Agent Host is a module-based environment designed to facilitate rapid experimentation and testing. It includes a docker-compose configuration with QuestDB, Grafana, and Code-Server. The AI Agent Host provides a seamless interface for managing and querying data, visualizing results, and coding in real-time.

The AI Agent Host is built specifically for `LangChain`, a framework dedicated to developing applications powered by language models. LangChain recognizes that the most powerful and distinctive applications go beyond simply utilizing a language model and strive to be data-aware and agentic. Being `data-aware` involves connecting a language model to other sources of data, enabling a comprehensive understanding and analysis of information. Additionally, being `agentic` allows a language model to actively interact with its environment. The AI Agent Host aligns with these principles and serves as a framework that supports LangChain's vision, providing a module-based environment for seamless data management, visualization, and real-time coding, thereby empowering developers to create advanced language model-driven applications.

## Features

1. **QuestDB**: QuestDB is a high-performance, open-source time-series database. It allows for efficient storage and querying of time-series data, making it ideal for working with real-time data streams.

2. **Grafana**: Grafana is a popular open-source platform for data visualization and monitoring. It provides a rich set of features for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing data from various sources.

3. **Code-Server**: Code-Server is a web-based IDE based on Visual Studio Code. It provides a familiar coding environment with features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging capabilities.
